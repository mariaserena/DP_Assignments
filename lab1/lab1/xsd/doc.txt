DTD documetation

Adopted choices:
- the func_type enumerates the possible functional type allowed;
- the links in the nffgs are contained in the node elements. Because links are "unidirectional", a link is just contained
	in one node. The link element was not put under the nffg element, because in this way we do not need a reference
	from the node element to the link element we avoid redundancies as asked by the assignment text;
- the connection element, instead, was created out of any host element because in this way it is not duplicated. 

The DTD file was designed to verify the same document structure of the XML schema file,
but no many constraints can be checked because of the limits of the DTD file. For example,
it was not possible to define the syntax of the entities names. Names where only defined as IDs,
that ensure uniqueness but no restrictions on the syntax. 

XML SCHEMA DOCUMENTATION:

The XML schema file allows to check that the entities names are unique and that there are references between
some attibutes of the entities and some outer entities (e.g. source_node and dest_node in a link reference the
node_name in a node).  In this case was also possible to put some restrictions on the syntax of the entities names
(as asked from the text of the assignment) by defining a new simple type in which there was specified the regular expression
"[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*".
