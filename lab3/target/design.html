<h2>Nfv Deployer Web Service Design Choices</h2>
<p>
The NfvDeployer Web service was designed to be a REST web service. It internally uses types that are 
defined in the xsd/NevDeployer.xsd 
XML schema. The shared data used by the system are declared in the src/NfvDB.java file and it was decided 
to use ConcurrentHashMaps to optimize the concurrency and scale well with hundreds of Nffgs. 
Private static long variables were also used to create the names of Nodes, Links and Nffgs.
The init phase requested by the text of the assignment was realized by implementing a singleton
pattern. In this way the init phase is called only when the first client connects to the service. 
The NfvDeployer exploits the Neo4jSimpleXML service only when it's necessary to deploy an Nffg,
save a node in a deployed Nffg, save a link in an already deployed Nffg or retrieve the hosts that 
are reachable from a node present in a deployed Nffg.
In the other cases (retrievement of the list of Nffgs, Nodes, etc.), the needed information are
retrieved from the internal DBs (shared data) of the service without accessing the Neo4j remote DB. 
The data submitted  by the client are validated by a customized MessageBodyReader that validates them against the
defined schema. Further validations are also performed by each operation to ensure the consistency of the 
internal DBs.
</p>
<p>
When the creation of a new Node is requested from a client, the service checks if the 
correspondent Nffg is deployed or not, tries to allocate the node on the host selected by the 
client (if any) and if fails it tries to allocate the node on an available host by using the first-fit
allocation algorithm. The information about the new node are then saved in the Neo4j DB and if the 
operation succeeds the correspondent data are also saved in the local DBs and the hosts are updated. 
Because the check on the host's availability and the host update take place in two different time
instants (respectively before and after the upload of the node information on the Neo4j DB), they are 
enclosed in a synchronized block that ensures thread-safety. 
When the deployment of a new Nffg is requested, for each node are performed the operation described above
and for each link (if any) are saved the needed info on the Neo4j DB and on the local DBs.
</p>
<p>
Because the name of the elements that has to be added to the system is chosen internally by the system, 
it's not possible to allocate two identical elements with the same name. The system does not perform any
already existing element check during the deployment of an Nffg or during the addition of a Node because it 
was not required by the text of the assignment, so to speed up the operations 
it was assumed that two equal Nodes/Nffgs could be allocated into the system.
As requested, instead, the already existing element check is performed when the addition of a link is requested 
and the client sets the "overwrite" query parameter to "false". 
In this case, the search is not performed by name (because, again, it is chosen by the system) but on the
nodes connected by the link. If the "overwrite" query parameter to "false" and the link is already present,
a 403 - Forbidden error is returned. Instead, if the "overwrite" query parameter to "true" and the link is 
already present, the old link is discarded and the new link is saved with the same name of the old one.
